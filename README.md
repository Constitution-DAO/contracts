### Getting started

1. We're looking at using Mirror or Juicebox.money to do a crowdfund for the token
2. In the meantime, we're also ramping up our own DAO governance and smart contracts in  https://github.com/Constitution-DAO 

Both things are happening in tandem. If you have questions, then ping @pmoncada on discord.

### FAQs

**Q: What is our highest priority?**

A: Security is the highest priority. This is going to be a high-profile raise and someone will try to exploit us in every way. Trusting someone with the $20M is unavoidable for making the bid. Either we need to convert to fiat ourselves and move to a bank, or we can partner with a non-profit to handle this for us. It is preferable to give contributors ownership of the DAO as they add funds instead of anything retroactive. Therefore at the moment we are leaning most towards using Juicebox due to their ease of minting tokens on contribution, fund overflow mechanics, and demonstrated battle-testing. As of right now, ConstitutionDAO core team is talking with some core developers at Juicebox to work out the details.

**Q: The soft commit form has options for non-eth. Is fiat contribution even possible?**

A: Depends what platform we end up choosing. We're waiting to hear back from some other discussions. Stay tuned!

**Q: What is our ENS?**

A: Our ens is `constitutiondao.eth` thanks to @alicemama
