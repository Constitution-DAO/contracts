### Getting started

1. We're looking at using Mirror or Juicebox.money to do a crowdfund for the token
2. In the meantime, we're also ramping up our own DAO governance and smart contracts in  https://github.com/Constitution-DAO 

Both things are happening in tandem. If you have questions, then ping @pmoncada on discord.
